Following the introduction to Cloud Security, Shared Responsibility Model, and Cloud Knowledge bases, the class focuses on the following 5 modules. Most of the learning is in line with hands-on classes.
##### Module 1 Lab
Administration, you will learn how to an on-ramp to AWS. You will work on AWS Console, AWS CLI and create a simple LAMP stack using Cloud Formation. You will create an EC2 machine and gain access to it. You will also setup S3 bucket. To gain access to course you will have to set up users and roles. 
##### Module 2 Lab
The audit, you will audit your own actions done under Module 1 by looking into CloudTrail logs.
##### Module 3 Lab
Build, you will be building Infrastructure as code using CloudFormation and other tools.
##### Module 4 Lab
Test, you will then learn to review CloudFormation as though you are doing a code review. We will use tools such as CloudSploit (basic and introductory) to understand security issues in Infrastructure as Code. We will then walk through a few of the lessons learned by the instructors in working with CloudFormation.
##### Module 5 Lab
You will quickly review a few AWS best practices, understand a few Enterprise considerations (enterprise = multi-cloud + on-prem), and the CIS benchmark.
You will then assess a sample stack using a few of the CIS benchmark checks. You will also understand how to leverage Trusted Advisory and AWS Inspector. As time permits you will look over the reports they produce.
