## Technology Track: AWS Security - One Day BootCamp
- [Top Of The Page](#current-offerings)
### Industry need
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a secure cloud services platform, offering computing power, database storage, content delivery and other functionality to help businesses scale and grow. AWS provides secure infrastructure and services, while you, the customer, are responsible for secure operating systems, platforms, and data.
This course will help you in understanding the security at the elevated level and to increase your confidence in securing the AWS environment hand on. Learning of theory is intentionally interspersed with labs on the main topics.
### Course Preview
Interactive learning modules include:
• Creating users
• Assigning roles/privileges
• Key encryption
• Log monitoring
• Log Analysis
• Creating/launching EC2 instances
• Creating S3 buckets
• Conducting compliance based assessment
### Modules
Following the introduction to Cloud Security, Shared Responsibility Model, and Cloud Knowledge bases, the class focuses on the following 5 modules. Most of the learning is in line with hands-on classes.
#### Module 1 Lab
Administration, you will learn how to an on-ramp to AWS. You will work on AWS Console, AWS CLI and create a simple LAMP stack using Cloud Formation. You will create an EC2 machine and gain access to it. You will also setup S3 bucket. To gain access to course you will have to set up users and roles. 
#### Module 2 Lab
The audit, you will audit your own actions done under Module 1 by looking into CloudTrail logs.
#### Module 3 Lab
Build, you will be building Infrastructure as code using CloudFormation and other tools.
#### Module 4 Lab
Test, you will then learn to review CloudFormation as though you are doing a code review. We will use tools such as CloudSploit (basic and introductory) to understand security issues in Infrastructure as Code. We will then walk through a few of the lessons learned by the instructors in working with CloudFormation.
#### Module 5 Lab
You will quickly review a few AWS best practices, understand a few Enterprise considerations (enterprise = multi-cloud + on-prem), and the CIS benchmark.
You will then assess a sample stack using a few of the CIS benchmark checks. You will also understand how to leverage Trusted Advisory and AWS Inspector. As time permits you will look over the reports they produce.
#### Module 6 Lab
Monitoring, Alerting, Auditing, and Incident Response
The lab will cover some of the topics mentioned above to provide you with hands-on training.
By the end of the course, you will have hands-on experience and understanding of AWS and Cloud Security to help you do your job better and perhaps even help accelerate adoption of Cloud at your organization.

## Technology Track: Security in DevOps - One Day BootCamp
- [Top Of The Page](#current-offerings)
### Industry need
DevOps is the evolution of need for speed in software and systems delivery lifecycles. Security is one of the harder non-functional areas to be incorporated into DevOps. This class will teach students the concepts of integrating Enterprise processes with security processes with Automation in mind. Students will then get to automate a few of the DevSecOps security steps within a Jenkins reference pipeline. Though not a pre-requisite, we recommend leveraging our OnRamp to IT security offering to get the most out of this class in terms of automation understanding. The AWS Security class will also add value to this class during hands-on exercises.  
### Course Preview
Our newest course builds on the skills learned in our previous classes yet introducing you to the software development lifecycle and the unique security threats that it presents. You will have more hands-on experience with our cutting edge AWS cloud technologies while learning about specific DevSec tools such as the Jenkins reference pipeline.
### Modules
#### Module 1
What is DevOps? What are the security concerns of DevOps? When and how to check if these concerns can materialize? How to assess the size of the impact if these concerns materialize?
#### Module 2
Understand and execute tasks from an Orchestration Engine used in DevOps. Understand issues with each of shell scripts, plug-ins, and loosely coupled invocation of security tools.
#### Module 2 Lab
Learn Jenkins navigation – and the brief overview of its orchestration ability
Create a job, configure a job to invoke a batch file, run the job, review the outputs, create logic based on output data, and invoke the next job
#### Module 3
Understand and execute code review
#### Module 3 Lab
##### Sample code review
Review a sample Python application, understand a few code vulnerabilities, understand and run Python Bandit code review tool, review the output, pipe the results back into Jenkins, automate the processing of some of the vulnerabilities data, invoke or abort next job based on the results
#### Module 4
Understand issues caused by third-party libraries. Understand issues caused due to issues with your supply chain
#### Module 4 Lab
##### Sample libraries review
Review a sample application, understand a few vulnerabilities due to insecure third-party libraries in it, understand and run OWASP Dependency check tool to discover all other vulnerabilities (CVEs), review the output, pipe the results back into Jenkins, automate the processing of some of the vulnerabilities data, invoke or abort
#### Module 5
Understand issues with automatic provisioning of infrastructure (NW, OS, stacks, containers, pods, etc.) that will host your application. Understand infrastructure as code security concerns
#### Module 5 Lab
##### Infrastructure review
Review a sample infrastructure; use automatic scripts discovery of a few vulnerabilities in one or more of infrastructure as code, NW, OS, files and directories, and containers (time permitting); review the output; pipe the results back into Jenkins; automate processing of some of the vulnerabilities data; invoke or abort next job based on the results
#### Module 6
Understand issues with web applications. Understand the impact of such issues on business and data.
#### Module 6 Lab
##### Dynamics scans
Review a sample vulnerable python web application; use automatic scan of the application using OWASP ZAP; invoke ZAP as a GUI, via command line invocation, via APIs, and via Jenkins plugin; review the output; pipe the results back into Jenkins; automate processing of some of the vulnerabilities data; invoke or abort next job based on the results

## Management Track: RapidStart for Current IT Professionals - One Day BootCamp
- [Top Of The Page](#current-offerings)
### Industry need
* Recent survey of 40K jobs asked for IT Security background: 25% Project Management, 23% Business Development, 9% Customer Relationship, 8% Business Analysts, 7% Sales6% Technical Writing, 
* Skills refresh is a reality today and IT Security can absorb retrained resources for a short while

### Course Preview
Round-table discussion is a major component of this course. 
Security Assessments overview and labs; Secure Software Development overview and labs; Security Testing overview and labs using DevOps tools where possible; Cloud Security Administration overview and labs; Security Job Market overview careers.
#### Module 1 
Security Assessments, Risk and Governance: Brief discussion on Risk Management Framework and CyberSecurity Framework, Controls assessments, gap determination and risk assessments are generally time consuming, cost a lot and are nuanced. It is also a 'Swiss cheese' method, with statistics giving the comfort of risk coverage of the holes. This class is meant to improve student’s ability to utilize assessment frameworks (RMF) and controls frameworks (800-53r4) with a more deeper understanding and with industry tools such as the DHS CSET, Cloud Security Alliance controls cross walks, Microsoft threat modeling tool among others.
#### Module 2
Secure Software Development: Secure Software Development is often an awareness problem as much as it is a coding problem. Knowing what common pitfalls are and what solutions are available and where is key to secure speed coding. This section thus focuses on helping students understand the OWASP Top 10 issues over the last two iterations. The focus then shifts to cheat sheets based methods of avoiding these pitfalls. Subsequently utilization of security libraries as well as selection of software libraries that are more secure is covered. Lab implements mitigation samples of common issues such as SQL Injection, Cross Site scripting, Cross Site Request Forgery etc. Finally, students are encouraged to put their code out on the Internet, on BL servers of course, and see how their coding holds up.
#### Module 3
Security Testing: Security Testing is a complicated affair. It is easy to turn on one tool and feel secure but in truth multiple tools are required, operating the tool properly is essential, and being able to understand the results of scans is needed. Clearly no set of tools will ever suffice – hence ability to manual testing, including pen test pivoting is to be learnt and practiced. Lastly, most Controls cannot be tested automatically, hence controls testing flavors will be covered. Tools used in this class will cover Python Bandit for code review, OWASP Dependency Check, few AWS CIS benchmark based security checks, and OWASP ZAP Proxy based dynamic scans.
#### Module 4
Security Administration, Continuous Monitoring: Security Administration is the most important piece in keeping a Business Secure and to reduce the loss to a company in event of a breach. This section cover Administration of the Security Controls learnt before. Labs are based on the AWS and Azure clouds.
