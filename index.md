## Banyan Logic, LLC
Banyan Logic is a cybersecurity firm headquartered in Reston, VA, USA. We provide Cyber Security training, process automation services, and auditing services for securing business solutions.

Banyan Logic is proud to announce the newest addition to our Cybersecurity training line-up: The Job Ready Defensive Cybersecurity Bootcamp (JRDC Bootcamp).

The Job Ready Defensive Cybersecurity Bootcamp is a training course unlike any other. In this course not only will you learn how to set up cloud-based business infrastructure securely but you will have actually to build and defend it from real cybercriminals; n the assets you create will be made live on the internet and tethered to a $50-$100 prepaid credit card. If you fully understand the security techniques that we teach you and implement them correctly, you will not lose one penny. You will be learning by doing not reading, making you a far more valuable job applicant in the ever-growing technology job market.
