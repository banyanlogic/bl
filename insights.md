## A.R.T. and Security (c)
### Purpose
The foundation of problem-solving is knowing whose problem we are trying to solve and what their pushes and pulls on an ongoing basis are. Therefore, a 360-degree scorecard is needed to evaluate a Security Organization or an SME relatability whom and for whom we secure. The A.R.T.* and Security (c) scorecard serves this purpose and is described below.

I look forward to your comments on this topic over LinkedIn @ <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/skasturi">http://www.linkedin.com/in/skasturi</a>

### Description
The * Absolute, Relative and Transactional (A.R.T.) friction factors can make or break Security. Consider these cause and effect relationships:
* Three friction-factors effect Security Groups from serving the Enterprise / Agency / Business goals in a secure manner
* Absolute Friction occurs and snowballs when the Stakeholders are not heard or understood or when Security is not heard or understood
* Relative Friction occurs and snowballs when there is Process disconnect
* Tactile Friction occurs and snowballs when Stakeholder's technology is not understood sufficiently and deeply by Security, or when security technology is not communicated sufficiently to Stakeholders

### Evaluation tool
Method to assess A.R.T. score is advocated based on the 'Empathy' (not sympathy nor apathy) that Security Groups have toward Enterprise / Agency / Business's goal. A list of lifecycles and a 'key concept' for each is leveraged to generate the score. A detailed scorecard is under development.

A more detailed calculator will be released soon.
