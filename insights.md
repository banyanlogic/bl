## A.R.T. and Security (c)
## A.R.T. and IT (c)
### Purpose
The foundation of problem-solving is knowing whose problem we are trying to solve and what their pushes and pulls on an ongoing basis are. Therefore, a 360-degree scorecard is needed to evaluate a IT Organization or an SME relatability whom and for whom we serve. The A.R.T.* scorecards serve this purpose and the basis is described below using Security as an example.

I look forward to your comments on this topic over LinkedIn @ <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/skasturi">http://www.linkedin.com/in/skasturi</a>

### Description
The Absolute, Relative and Transactional (A.R.T.) friction factors can make or break Security. Consider these cause and effect relationships:
* Absolute Friction occurs and snowballs when the Stakeholders are not heard or understood or when the Security Group is not heard or understood. Effect is irrelevancy of the Security Group.
* Relative Friction occurs and snowballs when there is a Process disconnect. Effect is inefficiency.
* Tactile Friction occurs and snowballs when Stakeholder's or Security Groups technology is not mutually understood in detail. Effect is insufficient automation.

### Evaluation tool
Method to assess A.R.T. score is based on weighted key 'empathy' attributes for each of the lifecycles that impact and are impacted by security activities. <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=sCcL4y7YvESdCVcMcTuu4OIitblMf7hIhnaXAD0Y67FUQk1DUUIxNTFPTDRTMDdMTlkxOEtTVTRIVy4u" target="_blank">Here is the link to the latest A.R.T. and Security (c) Coarse Grain Score v1 calculator form</a>. A more detailed calculator will be released soon.
