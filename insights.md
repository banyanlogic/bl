## A.R.T. and Security
#### Purpose
The foundation of problem-solving is knowing who's problem we are trying to solve and what there pushes and pull are. The one word that represents this mindset is empathy. Not sympathy toward business needs at risk of long-term security of customers and neither apathy toward such needs. But a balance that is needed to be the enabler. Toward this ends, evaluating a Security Organization or an SME state needs a 360/3D type scorecard. The A.R.T and Security scorecard serves this purpose. It is a concept that is deepening quickly so join us on this journey. Looking forward to your +/- comments.

#### Description
The Absolute, Relative and Transactional views and Security can be summarized as below:
* Three friction-factors effect Security Groups from serving the Enterprise / Agency / Business goals in a secure manner
* Absolute Friction occurs and snowballs when the Stakeholders are not heard or understood or when you are not heard or understood
* Relative Friction occurs and snowballs when there is Process disconnect
* Tactile Friction occurs and snowballs when Stakeholder's technology is not understood sufficiently and deeply by Security or when security technology is not communicated sufficiently to Stakeholders

#### Evaluation tool
* Method to assess A.R.T. score is advocated based on the 'Empathy' (not sympathy nor apathy) that Security Groups have toward Enterprise / Agency / Business's goal
