## A.R.T. and Security
The Absolute, Relative and Transactional views and Security
* Three friction-factors effect Security Groups from serving the Enterprise / Agency / Business goals in a secure manner
* Absolute Friction occurs and snowballs when the Stakeholders are not heard or understood or when you are not heard or understood
* Relative Friction occurs and snowballs when there is Process disconnect
* Tactile Friction occurs and snowballs when Stakeholder's technology is not understood sufficiently and deeply by Security or when security technology is not communicated sufficiently to Stakeholders
* Method to assess A.R.T. score is advocated based on the 'Empathy' (not sympathy nor apathy) that Security Groups have toward Enterprise / Agency / Business's goal
