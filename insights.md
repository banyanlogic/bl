## A.R.T. and Security (c)
### Purpose
The foundation of problem-solving is knowing who's problem we are trying to solve and what there pushes and pull are. The one word that represents this mindset is empathy, a balance between Business / Enterprise / Agency operational needs and security.

Toward this ends, evaluating a Security Organization or an SME state, needs a 360 degree scorecard. The A.R.T. and Security scorecard serves this purpose and is described below.

### Description
The Absolute, Relative and Transactional views and Security can be summarized as below:
* Three friction-factors effect Security Groups from serving the Enterprise / Agency / Business goals in a secure manner
* Absolute Friction occurs and snowballs when the Stakeholders are not heard or understood or when Security is not heard or understood
* Relative Friction occurs and snowballs when there is Process disconnect
* Tactile Friction occurs and snowballs when Stakeholder's technology is not understood sufficiently and deeply by Security, or, when security technology is not communicated sufficiently to Stakeholders

### Evaluation tool
Method to assess A.R.T. score is advocated based on the 'Empathy' (not sympathy nor apathy) that Security Groups have toward Enterprise / Agency / Business's goal. A list of lifecycles and a 'key concept' for each is leveraged to generate the score. A detailed score card is under development.
