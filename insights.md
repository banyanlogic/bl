## A.R.T. and Security (c)
### Purpose
The foundation of problem-solving is knowing whose problem we are trying to solve and what their pushes and pulls on an ongoing basis are. Therefore, a 360-degree scorecard is needed to evaluate a Security Organization or an SME relatability whom and for whom we secure. The A.R.T.* and Security (c) scorecard serves this purpose and is described below.

I look forward to your comments on this topic over LinkedIn @ <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/skasturi">http://www.linkedin.com/in/skasturi</a>

### Description
The Absolute, Relative and Transactional (A.R.T.) friction factors can make or break Security. Consider these cause and effects:
* Absolute Friction occurs and snowballs when the Stakeholders are not heard or understood or when the Security Group is not heard or understood. Effect is irrelevancy of the Security Group.
* Relative Friction occurs and snowballs when there is a Process disconnect. Effect is inefficiency.
* Tactile Friction occurs and snowballs when the Stakeholder\’s technology is not understood sufficiently and deeply by the Security Group, or when security technology is not communicated sufficiently to the Stakeholders. Effect is ineffectiveness against attacks.

### Evaluation tool
Method to evaluate the A.R.T. score is advocated based on the Empathy (not sympathy nor apathy) that Security Groups have toward their Enterprise, Agency, or Business’s goals. A list of lifecycles and one key-concept for each of the life cycles (scope as an example for Project Management Lifecycle) is collected and weighted to derive the score. Here is the link to the latest A.R.T. and Security (c) Coarse Grain Score v1 calculator. A more detailed calculator will be released soon.
